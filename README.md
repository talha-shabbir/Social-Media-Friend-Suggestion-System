# Social-Media-Friend-Suggestion-System

A simple C++ program that simulates a social media platform where users can:  
âœ… Add new users  
âœ… Connect and disconnect with friends  
âœ… Get friend suggestions based on mutual connections  
âœ… View all connections  
âœ… Find mutual friends between two users  

## How to Run  
1. Compile the program using:  
   ```sh
   g++ Project.cpp -o Project
  
2. Run the output file using:
   ```sh
   ./Project

## Features 

- Uses a 2D adjacency matrix to represent connections.

- Efficient friend suggestions using mutual connections.

- Simple console-based menu for interaction.

## Future Plans

This project is currently a console-based application, but I plan to develop a front-end interface in the future to enhance user experience.
